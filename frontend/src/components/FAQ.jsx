      question: "What are Generic Medicines?",
      answer: "Generic medicines contain the same active ingredients, dosage, and strength as branded medicines. They are equally effective and safe but cost 50-90% less because generic manufacturers don't have to spend on research, development, and marketing like branded companies."
    },
    {
      question: "Are Generic Medicines safe and effective?",
      answer: "Yes, absolutely! All generic medicines sold through PharmCure are approved by the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) and manufactured in WHO-GMP certified facilities. They undergo the same rigorous quality testing as branded medicines."
    },
    {
      question: "How much can I save with Generic Medicines?",
      answer: "You can save up to 85% on your medicine bills by switching to generic medicines. For example, if you spend ₹5000 per month on branded medicines, you could potentially bring that down to just ₹750-1000 with generic alternatives."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need a prescription to buy medicines?",
      answer: "Yes, for prescription medicines (Schedule H and H1 drugs), you need to upload a valid prescription from a registered medical practitioner. Over-the-counter medicines can be purchased without a prescription."
    },
    {
      question: "What is your delivery time?",
      answer: "We deliver within 2-5 business days across India. For metros and major cities, delivery is usually within 2-3 days. We also offer express delivery options in select cities."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I receive damaged or wrong medicines?",
